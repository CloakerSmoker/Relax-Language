## How To

`stable_version.exe` is the compiler executable, and is run as: `stable_version.exe [InputFile] [OutputExe]`

### How to use it

Run `stable_version.exe` with a UTF-8 encoded text (or `.rlx` file, the extension is unofficial, and not checked) as `[InputFile]` and a path to a `.exe` file as `[OutputFile]`. The compiler will run, report any errors, and write the output to `[OutputFile]`

Of course, writing the input file is a majority of the work.
