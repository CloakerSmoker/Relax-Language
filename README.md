# Relax, a fully compiled programming language, implemented entirely in AHK.

That's right, all of it is done in AHK. Yes, I know this is not a good thing.

For a quick example, see `Examples\HelloWorld.rlx` and `Examples\SimpleConsoleProgram.rlx`, which can be compiled with:

```
Main.exe -i Examples\OneOfThoseTwoFiles.rlx -o out.exe
```

And then run with

```
out.exe
```

For more info, see the [docs](https://cloakersmoker.github.io/Relax-Language/#).
